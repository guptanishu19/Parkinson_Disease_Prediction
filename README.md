Built a model using Decision Tree Classifier to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson's disease in an individual.

Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the CNS affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affect more than 1 million individuals every year in india.
This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine producing neurons in the brain.

Loaded the data, obtain the features and labels, scaled the feature, the splitted the dataset, built the DecisionTreeClassifier, changed the random state from 0 to 7 and then calculated the accuracy of the model.

Programming Language: Python3

libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, sklearn
